# HRnet
## Description
This project was carried out as part of an Openclassrooms training course.
The task was to migrate an HR application used to register employees from JQuery to React.
In this project, I created several React components to replace the JQuery library:
- a data table
- a Datepicker
- a Modal
- a Custom Select


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
